      <h2>Different internet principles</h2>
      <p>Internet is a enormous network that connects all the computers in the world, an example is how email travels through. Building on that, a Web is a public page where people can access through the internet via the browser, which is a Web where you can access all different kinds of webs, such as Chrome, firefox etc. these 3 elements are what makes the internet the internet. However, people might use it to do something illegal, that is where protocols come in place, it is an agreement which allows data to be transmitted and recieved, such as HTTP - hypertext protocol, and HTTPS - hypertext protocol secure. So when does it work? It works when a device or piece of equipment, such as a computer, intends to send a data object or file to one or multiple recipient devices, like a computer or server.</p>
